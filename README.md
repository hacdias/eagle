# Eagle

This powers my website. It is open-source. However, I won't be supporting other people's use
cases as this is just a personal project for personal use. If you're interested in doing
something similar, I encourage you to take a look at the code.

This repository replaces the old, JavaScript based, [API](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle-js).

## Update Plan

1. Create endpoints for:
   1. Creation / edition
   2. Deletion
2. Commit specific files. Services that change files should take the storae service.) 
3. Improve current search functionality and endpoint
   1. Allow more personalization on the website
   2. Allow the URL to indicate what we are searching
4. Stop relying on GoodReads for my reading section. Streamline reads file and make it easy to edit by myself (add custom link possibility for reviews).
5.  Improve bookmarks section using posts again. Format: /bookmarks/{slug}. Show them table like. Allow for search.
6.  CLI for local management.
7.  Solve newsletter/goodbye and thanks

### Notes

- Services must use local syncs. There must be some kind of global sync that allows to avoid calling hugo.Build while other operations are being some.
- Detect file types via middleware.
- Consider using .html instead of / with .html stripped in the end URL
- Move all pictures to a different place and flatten content directory to simple markdown files.
- Find a different place to put my activitypub data (sqlite db? other small db?)
