This powers my website. It is open-source. However, I won't be supporting other people's use
cases as this is just a personal project for personal use. If you're interested in doing
something similar, I encourage you to take a look at the code.

This repository replaces the old, JavaScript based, [API](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle-js).

## Notes

### GOAL: Support Markdown/RAW articles on Micropublish.net

https://github.com/barryf/micropublish/issues/42#issuecomment-704980299

### GOAL: provide each post in MF2, JF2 and AS2

- **Current implementation**
  - Hugo generates AS2
    - Missing attachments for posts that are mainly images or videos
  - MF2 is generated on the fly using a library from the HTML
  - Webfinger is provided statically

- **Idea**
  - Create a tool (or provide on the fly with caching) that:
    - Generates .mf2 (single, lists)
    - Adapt to .jf2 (single)
    - Adapt to .as2 (single)

### GOAL: make the website fast

- Should I keep the current implementation (Hugo + a bunch of APIs)?
- Should I move to a completly server-side rendering? Write post!

### GOAL: search!

- Maybe do a database indexing strategy
- Pros:
  - Easy to search.
- Cons:
  - Keep up to date with in-disk stuff.

### GOAL: better logging

- Solution: https://github.com/uber-go/zap
- Add zap logger to services and middleware
