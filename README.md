This powers my website. It is open-source. However, I won't be supporting other people's use
cases as this is just a personal project for personal use. If you're interested in doing
something similar, I encourage you to take a look at the code.

This repository replaces the old, JavaScript based, [API](https://github.com/hacdias/eagle-js).

## Notes

## GOAL: support ActivityPub

- Make Inbox
- Make Outbox (?)

## GOAL: local syncs

- Use local syncs per service. Services should return the files changed!
- Then, we can commit specific files!
