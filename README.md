This powers my website. It is open-source. However, I won't be supporting other people's use
cases as this is just a personal project for personal use. If you're interested in doing
something similar, I encourage you to take a look at the code.

## Install

```console
go install go.hacdias.com/eagle@latest
```

Or:

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/hacdias/eagle:latest
```
